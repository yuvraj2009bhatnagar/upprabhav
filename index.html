        <p class="ss">
            At Project Prabhav, we are committed to empowering underprivileged girls in STEM and enhancing the communication abilities of children with Down syndrome and Autism. <p class="ss-inner-2">Through Project अनुभूति, we ignite a passion for science and technology among young girls, providing them with the resources, mentorship, and support they need to explore their potential. Our goal is to bridge the gender gap in STEM, fostering a generation of confident, capable, and innovative women who will contribute to the technological advancements of tomorrow.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="ss-inner">With Project वाणी, we focus on improving speech and communication skills for children with special needs, offering specialized therapies and holistic family support. We understand that communication is a fundamental aspect of human connection, and our mission is to ensure that these children have the opportunity to express themselves and engage with the world around them. By providing personalized intervention programs and sustained support, we aim to empower children and their families to lead fulfilling lives.
            <br><br>
            At the heart of our work is a mission to inspire, empower, and create a brighter future for all.

                <br><br>
                <p class="ps-inner">A cornerstone of our program is the creation of individualized therapy plans. We recognize that every child has different strengths and challenges, so we carefully tailor our interventions to meet their specific needs. Our therapies include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral interventions, all aimed at helping children express themselves more effectively and build confidence.
                <br><br>
                In addition to direct therapy, we provide comprehensive support for families, understanding that they play a vital role in a child’s development. We offer education on communication strategies, counseling services, and a supportive community for families to connect and share experiences.
